## What is bHapticsRelay?

## bHaptics SDK Agreement

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use of bHaptics SDK (and therefore, bHapticsRelay) is subject to the bHaptics SDK agreement (https://bhaptics.gitbook.io/license-sdk/).

### No Affiliation with bHaptics

This project is an **unofficial community-driven tool**. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by bHaptics Inc.

For more details, see the [_Licensing Notes_](#licensing-notes) section at the end of this document.

### Project Scope

**bHapticsRelay** itself is a hobby project provided for free and without any warranties. It's ***not an official bHaptics product***, and it doesn't come with any game-specific profiles itself. The tool is essentially a lightweight integration layer and uses bHaptics's proprietary SDK libraries under the hood.

Modders must use the official bHaptics Designer and Developer Portal to create haptic patterns and events, and in turn may use this relay to trigger those events from their game mod.

Once deployed, players must use the official bHaptics Player software in conjunction with bHapticsRelay in order to feel the haptic effects.


# Configuration (`config.cfg`)

The core of every bHapticsRelay-powered mod is the `config.cfg` file. This required file configures the app title, tells bHapticsRelay which mode to run in (Log tail/WebSocket), and specified your bHaptics API key/app ID.

Below is a breakdown of each setting, what it does, and some practical examples.

## `[Settings]` section

### `Title`

   * **What it does:** Sets the window title and label in the bHapticsRelay UI.
   * **Valid values:** Any string (ideally the name of the game or mod).
   * **Use case:** If making a Streets of Rogue mod, you might use:

   ```ini
   Title=Streets of Rogue
   ```

   bHapticsRelay will display this string on the UI interface and in the titlebar as: 'bHapticsRelay for Streets of Rogue v{Version}'

---

### `Version`

   * **What it does:** Displays your mod's version in the title bar - handy for debugging and support.
   * **Valid values:** A semantic version string (e.g., `1.0.0`, `2.1.5-beta`).
   * **Use case:** During development you could bump this each build:

   ```ini
   Version=0.9.2-alpha
   ```

   bHapticsRelay will display this string in the titlebar as: 'bHapticsRelay for Streets of Rogue v0.9.2-alpha'   

---

### `Mode`

   * **What it does:** Chooses how bHapticsRelay listens for in-game events:

     * `Tail`: Reads a local log file and watches for [bHaptics] tags
     * `Websocket`: Listens on a port for SDK2 commands
   * **Valid values:** `Tail`, `Websocket` (case-insensitive)
   
   **Use case:** If your game or mod writes haptic events to `game.log`, go with Tail:

   ```ini
   Mode=Tail
   ```

   If you're using a custom client that pushes events over WS:

   ```ini
   Mode=Websocket
   ```

   Websocket mode will send replies if the command returns anything.

---

### `LogFile`

   * **What it does:** (Tail mode only) Specifies which log file to watch for **[bHaptics]** commands.
   * **Valid values:** Path to any plaintext log containing valid bHapticsRelay commands.
   * **Use case:** Many games write to `game.log`:

   ```ini
   LogFile=Logs/game.log
   ```

---

### `Port`


   * **What it does:** (Websocket mode only) Sets the TCP port for incoming command messages.
   * **Valid values:** Any open port (recommended range: `49152` - `65535` for non-application specific ports).
   * **Use case:** If port `50451` is free:

   ```ini
   Port=50451
   ```

---

### `TestEvent`

   * **What it does:** Name of a valid haptic event that fires when you hit the **Test** button in the UI - great for troubleshooting your pipeline.
   * **Valid values:** Any event identifier you've set in bHaptics Developer Portal.
   * **Use case:** If you have a heartbeat event:

   ```ini
   TestEvent=heartbeat
   ```

   When the 'Test' button is clicked, a `heartbeat` effect will be sent.

---

## `[bHaptics]` section

### `ApiKey`

   * **What it does:** This is your 20-character API key from the bHaptics Developer Portal used to authenticate calls to the online API.
   * **Valid values:** 20-character string (e.g., `abcd1234efgh5678ijkl`).
   * **Use case:** Copy from your portal section **Settings -> Application Information -> Latest API Key** and paste here:

   ```ini
   ApiKey=abcd1234efgh5678ijkl
   ```

### `AppId`

   * **What it does:** This is your 24-character deployment key or workspace ID from bHaptics Developer Portal.
   * **Valid values:** 24-character string (e.g., `1234567890abcdef12345678`).
   * **Use case:** Copy from your portal section **Settings -> Application Information -> Application ID** and paste here:

   ```ini
   AppId=1234567890abcdef12345678
   ```

### `DefaultConfig`

   * **What it does:** Path to the offline configuration JSON to be used as a fallback if the bHaptics Player can't reach the API.
   * **Valid values:** A valid `DefaultConfig.json` file you've downloaded from the Developer Portal (click _Download Default Config_ link after Deployment)
   * **Use case:** If you saved the JSON to your mod folder, specify the filename here (you can name it anything you want):

   ```ini
   DefaultConfig=DefaultConfig.json
   ```

---

## Required Keys

> [!WARNING]  
> The following settings *must* be present and non-empty, or bHapticsRelay will refuse to start:

```
Settings:Title
Settings:Version
Settings:Mode
bHaptics:ApiKey
bHaptics:AppId
```


## Deployment

This section covers packaging and shipping your finished mod.

After you've got your mod working and have your `config.cfg` dialed in, you can simply pack everything into a single .zip file and distribute that.

bHapticsRelay is standalone .NET 8 WPF app and does not require an installer. Players may extract the .zip to a folder anywhere on their PC and run from there.

### 1. Verify Package Contents

You should have these files in your .zip package:

```
bhaptics_library.dll
bHapticsRelay.exe
config.cfg
DefaultConfig.json
LICENSE
Readme.txt (see note below)
```

You can rename `bHapticsRelay.exe` if you want, to something like `bHaptics for AppName.exe` or whatever you prefer.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **Please do not omit the `Readme.txt` file** - it contains attributions for bHaptics, bHapticsRelay and other important information for the end-user.

You may modify the `Readme.txt` file (in fact, this would be recommended), but please use your best judgement and keep the attributions and important info intact. Thank you. :)

### 2. Zip and distribute

- **Create a single .zip** of the folder containing all files above.
- **Distribute** that archive (e.g., `MyMod-bHaptics.zip`) via your usual channels (Nexus, Moddb, GitHub Releases, etc.).

### 3. End-user Installation

End users will install and run the mod as follows. More detailed instructions are included in `Readme.txt`.

1. **Unzip** the archive to any folder on their PC (no admin rights needed).
2. **Double-click** `bHapticsRelay.exe` to launch the relay. They'll see your game title, version, and Test Event button.

> [!NOTE]  
> All paths in `config.cfg` are relative to the EXE's folder, so players can drop the whole folder anywhere such as on the desktop, in `Program Files`, or even in the game folder itself.

Once you have everything dialed in, switch to the Release version and you should be good to go. Feel free to open an Issue or reach out if you have any questions.

# Game Integration Guide

This section is for mod developers who want to emit events from their game scripts to trigger haptics via bHapticsRelay.

Depending on your game and modding environment, you can choose to use log file output or direct WebSocket messages. 

This section covers how to implement both, with an example using OpenMW (Morrowind) Lua modding.

**Basic Requirements**

For this setup to work, you must have some way of controlling what the game writes to a log file, and when. 

The game engine must support some kind of scripting or mod support to achieve this, or you may also be able to add custom logging if the game's source code is available.

## Log File Tailing

In log tailing mode, your game or mod needs to output lines to a text file, using the `[bHaptics]command` syntax. When bHapticsRelay is tailing that file, any time it sees that pattern, it will trigger the named haptic event.

**General Approach**

Identify a suitable log file. Many games output to a log file by default (for example, Unity games usually have a Player.log, older games have their own logs, etc.).

If your target game already has a log, find its location. If it's constantly appended to, bHapticsRelay can tail it.

If the game's log is hard to locate or rotates often, an alternative is for your mod to create its own log file just for haptics.

In your mod code, print or write lines that include `[bHaptics]command` at the appropriate times. Ideally, each haptic trigger is on a separate line, but it can be amidst other text.

**OpenMW Example**

In my bHaptics mod for OpenMW (The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind engine), I use the built-in Lua scripting scripting system that allows mods to run code on game events.

By default, using OpenMW Lua's print() function will write to OpenMW's log file (openmw.log). We can leverage this to send haptic commands.

Here is part of my Lua mod script for OpenMW:

```lua
return {
    engineHandlers = {
        -- Haptics for consuming items
        onConsume = function(item)
            -- Get the item type
            itemType = tostring(item.type)

            if itemType == ("Potion") then
                print("[bHaptics]play,drinkeffect")
            end

            if itemType == ("Ingredient") then
                print("[bHaptics]play,eateffect")
            end
        end,
    }
```

In the above snippet, whenever the player consumes an item, the script checks if they are consuming a Potion or Ingredient.

When a Potion is used by the player, this code is triggered whcih in turn writes `[bHaptics]play,drinkeffect` to the log file.

bHapticsRelay sees this and processes the command as `play,drinkeffect` which is then sent to the bHaptics Player to trigger haptic feedback.

As a result, the player feels a 'potion drinking' effect anytime they drink a potion. Neat, eh!? :)

### Tips for log integration:

**Ensure the tag is exact**

The relay looks for the exact case-sensitive string `[bHaptics]` in the log line. Make sure your output matches this format exactly, including the square brackets and capitalization. The event name inside is also case-sensitive and should exactly match what you have in your haptic config (IDs typically are lowercase).

**Write one event per line**

It's safest to output the tag in its own line or at least ensure it's not appearing multiple times in one line. The relay will typically trigger on the first occurrence per line.

If you want to trigger multiple events at once, you can output multiple lines (the relay can handle them in quick succession).

**Log timing**

The relay reads the log file continuously. There may be a tiny delay (typically only milliseconds) between your mod writing the line and the relay reacting, depending on file I/O buffering. For most haptic feedback, this latency is negligible.

**Custom log files**

If your mod can write to a file directly (e.g., using file I/O in Lua or a plugin in another language), you might consider making a dedicated `haptics.log` file. That way, you can point bHapticsRelay to this file and you won't have other unrelated log spam.

## WebSocket Mode

In WebSocket mode, your mod needs to act as a client that sends messages to a local WebSocket server hosted by bHapticsRelay. This allows more structured and potentially faster communication (no disk I/O). The trade-off is that your modding environment must support networking or an external script.

**General Approach**

From your mod or script, establish a WebSocket connection to `ws://localhost:<port>` (make sure the port matches the one you specified in `config.cfg`). The relay will accept the connection from any local client.

> [!NOTE]  
> For security reasons, **only clients on the same PC or LAN** can connect to bHapticsRelay. The websocket server is not accessible over the internet.

**Send Commands**

Once connected, your mod can send commands as simple text messages. For example, sending `play,heartbeat` will issue a heartbeat effect to bHaptics Player.

The server will respond with return values if the command has any.

**External Python Client**

If your modding environment doesn't support WebSockets directly, another approach is to create a small external Python script or program that interfaces with the game (via memory reading or other means) and then sends WebSocket messages.

For example, a Python script could listen for game events (through an API or memory watch) and then use a WebSocket client library to forward those events to bHapticsRelay. This essentially offloads the event detection to an external process which might be easier in some cases.

**Python Testing Script for WebSocket Mode**

Here is a small script I've put together for testing the WebSocket mode. This will allow you to send messages to bHapticsRelay via WebSocket and will display the returned results.

```python
from websocket import create_connection

# Set the URL and port to connect to
url = "ws://localhost:50451"

try:
    ws = create_connection(url)
    print("Connected. Type messages to send. Type 'exit' or 'quit' to close.")
    print("Example: play,heartbeat")

    while True:
        msg = input("> ")
        if msg.lower() in ('exit', 'quit'):
            break
        ws.send(msg)
        print("Sent:", msg)
        try:
            response = ws.recv()
            print("Received:", response)
        except Exception as recv_err:
            print("Error receiving response:", recv_err)
            break

    ws.close()
    print("Connection closed.")
except Exception as e:
    print("Error:", e)
```

Feel free to use as needed for debugging, or adapt to your use case.

### Tips for WebSocket integration:

Here are a few things to keep in mind when using WebSocket to ensure a reliable experience.

**Choose a stable port**
Ports below 49151 may be used by other services, so ideally you should use a port in the range of 49152 - 65535.

Best practice would be to make your mod easily configurable on the client side, so you can easily change the port if needed.

**Connection handling**

Your mod should ideally handle the case where bHapticsRelay isn't running or the socket can't connect. Usually, if the relay isn't up, the connection will refuse, so some error handling here would be useful on your mod's client side.

**One message at a time**

Always send a single command per message. Do not send multiple commands per message; bHapticsRelay processes messages individually.

**Performance notes**

WebSocket mode is very low-latency and is suitable for rapid or frequent events. However, be mindful not to spam too many haptic events too quickly - overlapping too many patterns can overwhelm the end user with too much feedback and then it just feels like constant vibrations. Consider using intensity or logic in your mod to throttle or combine events if needed.

**Use cases for Websocket**

This mode might be the only option for games that do not have easily accessible logs, or if you want your mod to interact with the bHaptics Player since log mode doesn't offer any feedback.

## Ensuring Correct Event Mapping (capitalization, etc)

Regardless of which mode you choose to use, one crucial aspect is making sure the Event IDs you trigger from the game match those in your bHaptics configuration in Developer Portal.

After you set up events in the Developer Portal or Designer, keep a reference of event names either in your mod comments or config so it's easy to update if you change them on the portal side.

If there's any mismatch (typo, different case, etc) you will see an error in bHaptics Player 'eventName not registered in this Workspace'. Double-check spelling and make sure you're using the same event names from the Developer Portal after selecting Deploy.

If you change any of the event names in the portal, make sure to keep everything in sync in your mod code and the portal side.
  
# Example Implentations

## Test Suite

I've included a Test Suite which can be used to test bHapticsRelay, along with an example implementations with some effects to try. The Test Suite also includes a way to test all commands in SDK2 to become familiar with them.

### [bHapticsRelay_Test_Suite.pyw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dteyn/bHapticsRelay/refs/heads/master/bHapticsRelay_Test_Suite.pyw)
(right click, Save As)

**Requirements:** [Python 3.x](https://python.org)

To use it, make sure bHapticsRelay is started and in Websocket mode. Then, start the Test Suite and make sure the Websocket address/port are correct, and click Connect.

You can then try various commands to see how they work and verify that bHapticsRelay is working correctly.

You can also use this with your own project's API key to test everything; simply edit the `config.cfg` and/or `DefaultConfig.json` for bHapticsRelay to use your project, and then start the test suite. It will list out the effects from your project and let you test them accordingly.

The test suite is just a simple Python script for now and I don't intend to improve it further, but if anyone wants to submit improvements for that I'll happily merge them.


## OpenMW (Morrowind) bHaptics

My first implementation of bHapticsRelay will be [OpenMW-bHaptics](https://github.com/Dteyn/OpenMW-bHaptics) which uses the log tailing mode to add bHaptics effects to the game.

It's a work-in-progress and as of writing this, the repo is currently empty. Once published, I'll come back here to update this with some more details on how it works.


## Other Examples

bHapticsRelay is flexible and can be used in many ways. Below are a few examples of how bHapticsRelay can be used in conjunction with Python.

> [!NOTE]
> bHaptics provides a library for direct suport within Python: [tact-python](https://github.com/bhaptics/tact-python)
> The below examples are provided only to illustrate how bHapticsRelay works; `tact-python` should be considered first if you are developing something in Python to interface with bHaptics Player directly.

## Twitch Chat Bot with haptic effects

Using [twitchio](https://twitchio.dev/), you can create a simple Twitch Bot to listen for chat commands and write haptic instructions to a log file monitored by bHapticsRelay and trigger effects.

The below example listens to Twitch chat for commands (like `!bhaptics explosion`) and writes lines such as `[bHaptics]play,explosion` to a text file. bHapticsRelay can pick this up and trigger an effect.

```python
import twitchio
from twitchio.ext import commands

LOGFILE = r"C:\Path\To\Your\logfile.log"  # <-- Use the same file set in bHapticsRelay config!

class Bot(commands.Bot):

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            token="oauth:YOUR_TWITCH_OAUTH_TOKEN",
            prefix="!",
            initial_channels=["your_channel"]
        )

    async def event_message(self, message):
        if message.echo:
            return

        # Only trigger on commands like "!bhaptics something"
        if message.content.lower().startswith("!bhaptics "):
            effect = message.content.split(" ", 1)[1].strip()

            # Ensure the effect name is lowercase
            effect = effect.lower()

            # Write to log file in the format bHapticsRelay expects
            with open(LOGFILE, "a", encoding="utf-8") as log:
                log.write(f"[bHaptics]play,{effect}\n")
            print(f"Triggered haptic: {effect}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    bot = Bot()
    bot.run()
```

Again, consider [tact-python](https://github.com/bhaptics/tact-python) first if you're developing something like this, but this is a good example of how any text file can be used to trigger haptics with bHapticsRelay - not just game log files.

## Monitoring Game Memory (Advanced)

This is out of the scope of this guide, but if you are able to monitor RAM for specific values and then based on those, write events to a log file (or send over Websocket), that's another way you could trigger haptics based on what's happening in the game.

Python library [`pymem`](https://pymem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) may be worth looking at for this type of solution.


## Using Named Pipes

If your game or mod can write to a named pipe, a Python script can read from it and forward messages to bHapticsRelay, using either Websocket or by writing to a text file.



# Future Ideas

## Community Contributions

As an open-source, hobbyist-focused project, bHapticsRelay welcomes contributions from the community.

Whether it's code improvements, new features, or simply testing and feedback, all help is appreciated. If you have an idea or find a bug, feel free to open an issue or pull request on the GitHub repository. Modders often have creative solutions and specific needs, so this project can evolve with community input.

## Support for Additional Input Methods

Right now, only log or WebSocket are supported input methods. The next most obvious input method to tackle would be named pipes, but I don't have much experience with that yet.

## SDK1 Support

Currently, only SDK2 is integrated and supported. Adding support for SDK1 via `.tact` files would be a great way to extend the program.

Since SDK1 is deprecated, I don't currently have plans to add SDK1 support, but if someone else wants to add it for backwards compatibility, I'm certainly open to pull requests on that.

## Better UI/UX

The UI is pretty minimal at the moment. bHaptics SDK2 allows for more detail from the player, so in theory could add a section for devices connected or even show haptic feedback patterns in the app.

# Contributions

If you are a developer interested in any of the above features or have your own, don't hesitate to fork the project and experiment. I just ask that you share your improvements back with the community if possible. Given this is for fun and the betterment of immersive gaming, collaboration is key!

# Reporting Issues

For any bugs or unexpected behavior, please open an issue on the repository. Include details like the log output of bHapticsRelay, your config, and what you were doing.

# Bhaptics SDK2 API Reference

bHapticsRelay **fully supports** all functions provided by `bhaptics_library.dll`. Each available function from triggering haptic effects to querying device status is wrapped and accessible directly through bHapticsRelay.

I've also updated `BhapticsSDK2Wrapper.cs` (based on [original source](https://github.com/bhaptics/tact-csharp2/blob/master/tact-csharp2/tact-csharp2/BhapticsSDK2Wrapper.cs) from [bHaptics tact-csharp2](https://github.com/bhaptics/tact-csharp2)) to include comments on usage for each of the exports available in `bhaptics_library.dll`.

For reference, I've documented all exported functions below to assist with integrating bHapticsRelay or BhapticsSDK2Wrapper into other projects.

C# examples are provided for every function, and bHapticsRelay command examples are also provided for most.

> [!WARNING]  
> Some details below may be incorrect. If anything is inaccurate, please create an Issue with corrected details and I'll update accordingly.
